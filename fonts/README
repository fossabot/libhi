These fonts are converted to a header with "xxd -i foo.ttf >fonts.h",
which is included by the library. This is easier than trying to
convince libtool to append a binary artifact in a cross-platform way.

We keep copies of the original TTF files here, just in case we need to
re-generate the headers later.
